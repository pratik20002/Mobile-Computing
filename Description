Brief Description of Design Relevance to Target Demographic:

The design is relevant to users of all ages because it focuses on simplicity and accessibility.
The clear, user-friendly interface allows individuals to easily input their information and take the color blindness test without requiring technical expertise.
Large, readable text, straightforward buttons, and minimal navigation make it intuitive for users of any age group, including children, adults, and elderly users. 
The option to export the test results further enhances the design's practicality, allowing results to be shared with caregivers, educators, or healthcare professionals as needed. 
Additionally, accessibility features, such as adjustable text sizes and high-contrast options, ensure that users with varying levels of visual acuity can comfortably use the app. 
This inclusive design aligns well with the goal of reaching a broad audience.
