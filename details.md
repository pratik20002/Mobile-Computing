**Intended Platform**
iOS and Cross-Platform

**Intended Framework/Programming Language**
Swift (for iOS), React Native (for Cross-Platform)

**Cross-Platform Development**
Yes, I plan to explore cross-platform development using React Native.

**Explanation**
I chose **iOS** as my primary platform because of my growing interest in mobile development and my background in software engineering. With experience in frameworks like **React.js** from my previous work, exploring **React Native** for cross-platform development feels like a natural extension of my skills. Using **Swift** will help me dive deeper into native iOS development, while **React Native** allows me to leverage my existing JavaScript knowledge to build apps for both iOS and Android efficiently. This combination aligns with my goal of developing scalable, multi-platform applications and complements my prior work on projects at eQ Technologic.
